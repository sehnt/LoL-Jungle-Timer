Currently contains 3 pages:
 - Main Timer
 - Hotkeys
 - Ingame Timer

The Ingame Timer page is meant to cover up the actual League of Legends timer with this application's timer.
 - You can access this page by double clicking anywhere on the application (except a button). 
 - To exit the Ingame Timer, double click on the application once again.
 - The application will shrink and automatically move to the correct position for a 1080p monitor on 100% scaling.

 - Reset the timer
 - Skip 30 seconds (Actually skips ~27.7 seconds to mimic practice tool)
